you are an office worker, who has to wake up and come into the office everyday

there is a desk that you view from a top-down perspective, in which there is a fax machine to the left, that spits out papers for you to mark up to complete

once they are complete, you move them to a done pile in the corner, and every once in a while someone comes by to pickup the done pile

the amount you get per second out of the fax machine is something that is upgradable
same goes with the speed you can finish a piece of paper, and the ability to automate filling out a piece of paper
same goes with the papers you have going into the done pile
same goes with the rate at which someone comes by to pickup the done pile

you have the option to take breaks for productivity, and pick what time of the day you leave
